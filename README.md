Progress

Currently there are 16 RESTful routes for our 3 core functionalities,
- Create Events
- Get User (get member) 
- Search Events (get events by tag)

However, we added more routes for other functionalities including:
- Create user
- Update member
- Delete member
- Add event
- Get event by name
- Update event
- Delete event
- Add places
- Get places
- Update place
- Delete place
- Add ratings
- Get rating


Currently all routes that involves requesting and deleting data are data from a separate file called db.js.

All routes that involves adding data are added to the group's MLab. Routes for updating data are the data in the MLab.

The first core functionality is about the user. The functionality consists of:
  - user signup
  - user login
  - user profile

Temporarily, the website starts at user login, a failed login will open a failure page. A successful login will open the user profile of that particular user. The database is stored in mLab. The user profile page is currently just a template but it does display the sign up information of that user. A button in user login will open the signup page where the user must fill in their information. Any errors such as leaving blank spaces, improper email, or incorrect password typed will open a failure page. Otherwise it will send the json page of that user meaning it is stored inside mLab.

Deliverable 4

We have successfully implemented the front and back-end of our three original functionalities:

1. Get user (get member), which includes:
    - Sign Up
        - enter their details
        - upload profile picture
        - add their interest
    - Login
    - get the userâ€™s profile page
    - display their data

First, the user will be directed to the login page, where if they don't have an account, they must create a new account. Once they've filled in their details and created their new account, they will be sent an email confirmation tp confirm their account has been made. Then they will be directed to a login page, where they can now see their profile with the details they've entered from signing up. They can also upload their profile picture and add their interests.

2. Search Events based on tags which includes:
    - Search events by name
    - Filter events by tag

From their profile page, the user have access to the find events from the menu bar on the top left corner. They can search the name of the event they want to attend and the search page will display a list of events. They can also filter the list of events by tags and only the events with the corresponding tag will show.

3. Create events which includes:
    - Create Event
    - Go to the created event page to see the details

The user also has access to create a new event from their profile page using the menu bar on the left of the screen. First they must fill in the details about the event (time, date, place, organizer, pictures). Then they can create their new event and they can search their event in the search page and see the details they've entered.

Other functionalities with their front end and back end done includes:
4. Add ratings and reviews
5. Maps
6. users can add events their interested in to their profile page
7. Join user (a button on the event page and their response is recorded in the database)

We also started developing the front end on some pages including: 
- about page
- home page: which will direct new users to create a user account and login.

Some backend functionalities we've created:
